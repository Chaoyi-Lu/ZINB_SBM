# Zero-Inflated Nagetive-Binomial Stochastic Block Model

This repository provides the code and applications for the two simulation studies and one real data application shown in the paper *Zero-Inflated Nagetive-Binomial Stochastic Block Model*.
All the functions required for the implementations are included in the file `Functions_for_ZINB_SBM.R`.
The notes for the code application and corresponding explanations are mainly based on the files `Simulation_Study_Application.md` and `Real_Data_Application.md` which, respectively, correspond to the simulation studies and real data application.

The `.csv` files provide the artificial network data we illustrated in the paper.
The `.csv` files beginning with `SS1_ZINBSBM_N75K3...` store the synthetic network data randomly simulated from the zero-inflated Negative-Binomial stochastic block model (ZINB-SBM) for the simulation study $1$ (SS1).
The `.csv` files beginning with `SS2_ZIPSBM_N75K3...` store the synthetic network data randomly simulated from the zero-inflated Poisson stochastic block model (ZIP-SBM) for the simulation study $2$ (SS2).
